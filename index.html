			<p><span>The book project <em>Bailing On Dystopia</em>, a collection of science fiction and speculative fiction by New Yorkers and Philadelphians, is about both imagination and action. <em>Bailing on Dystopia</em> is about imagination because it uses fantastical modes of writing to think beyond the dystopia that so often takes over our lives, both in the worlds of creativity and in the struggles we see and experience every day. <em>Bailing On Dystopia</em> is about action because it is a fundraiser project, with all of its proceeds directed to a community bail fund that will pay the bail for people in New York and Philadelphia jails who cannot afford to pay. This fund will be an immediate action that we can take to move beyond the real life dystopia in NYC and Philadelphia now.</span></p>

He read "how to write and author's bio" recently and isn't sure that he's doing it right.&nbsp;</p>

			<p class="smaller"><i>There is an island of jails in New York, the “Greatest City on Earth,” which holds people incarcerated – people who have not been convicted of a crime. Time begins to move backwards, or perhaps multiple times simultaneously. Donald Trump is president, and he plans to build an enormous impenetrable wall surrounding the entire US and remove access to confusingly, both birth control and abortions. Work becomes primarily automatized, and those who are pushed out of work are sent to mandatory Redundancy Residence colonies. NYPD set up mobile checkpoints that appear and disappear seemingly randomly in mostly Black neighborhoods, where they arrest and demand fees for obscure and strange crimes. There are two strains of a species with strictly separated roles in society, but there is a being born who cannot fit either role and shocks the world. These are the dystopias we live, and the ones we imagine. In Bailing on Dystopia, the characters in our stories come up with ways to make change and survive within. We do the same.</i></p>
