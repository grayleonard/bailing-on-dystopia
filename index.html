<p>The Bailing on Dystopia Collective is invested in bailing out everyone. The common sense, reasonable thinking which defines this dystopian world in which we live, would say this is not possible. In this reality, where we have been trained to believe that the impossible remains impossible, we cannot bail everyone out of jail. Luckily, this is a book of science fiction, written for a dystopian sci-fi world. Here, now, our job is to imagine, and then realize, the impossible. It’s exactly what science fiction is so good at helping us accomplish, and exactly what we want to do.</p>

<p>This project was devised as an indignant response to the premature death of Kalief Browder, who was held in jail as a youth at Rikers Island for three years for a crime of which he was not convicted, because he could not make bail. During his three years of baseless incarceration, two of which were spent in solitary confinement, Kalief experienced severe physical and psychological abuse by prison guards and inmates alike. Though he was released and his case dropped in 2013, his experiences in jail, and the grief experienced by his family, who refused to accept a settlement for their injustice, brought Kalief to commit suicide in June 2015. Kalief’s case, and ultimately his death, brought on a massive surge in public discussion about the injustices of the bail system in the United States. This book situates itself as part of this discourse, and as a direct challenge to the bail system and to incarceration itself.</p>
<p>Our response is two-fold: imagination and action. In this book, we use science fiction stories to think beyond dystopia. We project our greater vision for justice, and our greater vision for how to be in the context of repression and violence. The Bailing on Dystopia Collective is dedicated to responding to people’s immediate needs. We urge you to do the same by buying this book and supporting people’s needs in your communities. With this book, we aim to <i>free people now</i>. The proceeds from this book will go directly to bail funds in New York and Philadelphia. These are two comrade cities with deep intersections in the struggles that they face, as well as in their shared communities of people in struggle. The authors included in this book reside in, love in, and struggle in these cities. The Bailing on Dystopia Collective thanks the authors for the donation of their excellent stories, as well as the volunteer labor contributed by all involved to make the book happen.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>There is an island of jails in New York, the “Greatest City on Earth,” which holds people incarcerated – people who have not been convicted of a crime. Time begins to move backwards, or perhaps multiple times simultaneously. Donald Trump is president, and he plans to build an enormous impenetrable wall surrounding the entire US and remove access to confusingly, both birth control and abortions. Work becomes primarily automatized, and those who are pushed out of work are sent to mandatory Redundancy Residence colonies. NYPD set up mobile checkpoints that appear and disappear seemingly randomly in mostly Black neighborhoods, where they arrest and demand fees for obscure and strange crimes. There are two strains of a species with strictly separated roles in society, but there is a being born who cannot fit either role and shocks the world. These are the dystopias we live, and the ones we imagine. In Bailing on Dystopia, the characters in our stories come up with ways to make change and survive within. We do the same.</i></p>
